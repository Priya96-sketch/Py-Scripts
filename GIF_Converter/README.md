- GRAPHICAL INTERCHANGE FORMAT. Series of images of soundless videos that loops continuously that doesn't requirs any press play button. 
- AKA ANIMATED IMAGES.
- Gifs are basically the compressed format of the video and they are used in places where very few colors are used,they are mostly used in logos as such. These gifs are compressed using lossless data compression in-order not to degrade the video quality.
- GIFs are gaining popularity because, like memes, they’re useful for communicating jokes, emotions, and ideas. These services are integrated into apps like Twitter, and your phone’s keyboard, so they’re just as easy to use as emojis or “stickers.”
